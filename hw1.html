            <h3>What is Statistics?</h3>
            <p>
                Let's start by responding with a suggestive quote from the <i>International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science</i>:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">"Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data."</p>
            <p>
                More formally, statistics can be described as the science concerned with the development and study of methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. <br>
                Statistics, whether you consider it a branch of mathematics or a distinct mathematical science, is particularly connected to probability theory: from experiments design to achieve a representative sample of the population, to the measure of uncertainty. A representative sample assures that inferences and conclusions of the analysis can safely extend to the entire population.<br>
                There are two main statistical methods: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &nbsp;<b>Descriptive statistics ></b> which summarize data from a sample, using "indexes" (measures);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inferential statistics ></b> which interprets data from a population sample to induce statements and predictions about the population as a whole. Probability theory deals with the random variation that characterize the sampled data, as extracted from the real-world.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p><p>
                Probability is also used to discuss uncertain events, i.e. outcome of a question not determined yet, or not known.
            </p>
            
            <h4>A brief history of statistics</h4>
            <p>
                The first formal discussions about statistical analysis date back to the <i>Islamic Golden Age</i> (8th - 13th century); then, over hundreds of years, the sense of the word statistics has evolved. This term was adopted by the German <b>Gottfried Achenwall</b> in 1749, who intedded it with a more general sense than the first introducer: the Italian <b>Girolamo Ghilini</b> in 1589. In fact, the Italian writer and scholar considered only a specific case: collection of facts and information about a state (demographic, economic data).<br>
                Then in the early 19th century the discipline of statistics included the collection and analysis of data in general. Later, the modern field of statistics emerged in three stages, transforming statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis in many sectors and by adding concepts that nowadays are fundamental.
            </p>
            <p>The advent of computers has brought a very fast machine to compute statistical analysis. But also, a lot of new data to play with!</p>
            
            <h3>Why can it be useful for cybersecurity?</h3>
            <p>First things first, let's introduce <span class="live-effect">Cybersecurity!</span></p>

            <h4>What is cybersecurity?</h4>
            <p>
                Analyzing the word itself, is composed of cyber and security; the security of the cyber domain.<br>
                Cysec is the art of protecting networks, devices and data from unauthorized access or criminal use. Its objective is also to ensure the confindentiality, integrity and availability of information, so that the both critical and entertainment systems we rely on everyday can operate without threats.
            </p>

            <h4>Statistics applied to cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>
                For anyone who don't see a connection between the two topics, change your mind!<br>
                As written above, the first known signs of statistical analysis dates back to the 8th century, where mathematicians and cryptographers used frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statistical methods are useful in cybersecurity for the assessment of risks, effectiveness of security measures and to predict potential threats, by analyzing and identifying trends. These information are crucial to make informed decisions about the security policies to adopt.<br>
                Let's be practical and see some examples of statistics application in the everyday life of a cysec professional:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Descriptive statistics ></b> the starting point of any risk evaluation used to get insights about the frequency, severity and distribution of past security events.</li>
                    <li><b>Probabilistic analysis ></b> probability distribution, bayesian analysis. Different types of distribution help estimate the probability of future events or the time between consecutive attacks.<br>
                    For instance, the Bayes' Theorem is used in real-time anomaly detection models, which detects observations, events or data points that deviate from what is usual or expected.</li>
                    <li><b>Regression analysis ></b> to identify relationships, and factors that most significantly influence the risk of incidents.</li>
                    <li><b>Simulations ></b> like Monte Carlo simulation that, simulating a number of possible outcomes, provides a range of plausible future risk profiles.<br>
                    For instance, Monte Carlo simulation can <a href="https://isaca.nl/how-to-gain-more-bang-for-the-buck-quantifying-risk-with-random-simulations/">estimate the potential financial impact of data breaches</a> over future periods.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, statistics is essential for many different disciplines because it enables conscious decisions based on evidence and facts. The cyber domain depends heavily on statistics in every phase: from risk assessment, attack vectors prediction, detection, to incident analysis (when the damage is already been done).
